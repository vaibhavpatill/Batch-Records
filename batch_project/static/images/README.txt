Company Logo Instructions
========================

To use your company logo in the SSRS report:

1. Place your company logo image file in this directory
2. Name it "company_logo.png" (or update the path in the SSRS report)
3. Recommended size: 150x80 pixels
4. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, GIF

The logo will appear in the top-left corner of the batch process report.

If you don't have a logo file, the report will show a placeholder or may display an error for the image element.
